    <h1>PROJECTS</h1>
    
    <h3>Watchdog (Hack ISU - Fall 2018)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Android service to detect assault or situations of distress based on speech and hardware data
        analysis. In case of an emergency, an SMS with a GPS link is sent to emergency contacts and
        emergency services. <br>
        By completing this project I gained more experience with Android development, data analysis,
        and open source libraries.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Eyeglass (Hack ISU - Spring 2018)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Android augmented reality application to aid individuals with different kinds of disabilities by
        assisting with facial and emotion recognition in real-time. <br>
        During development, our team had to “hack” a phone in order to access the camera and the
        video feed metadata. In addition to hardware modification, our team got to build our first Android
        application, use the Google Vision API which uses the phone for computations.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Whiteboard Drawing Robot (Hack ISU - Spring 2017)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        3D printed components to build a robot capable of taking a list of coordinates and drawing them
        on a whiteboard. The coordinates were generated by an image processing application that
        mapped an image to a 2-dimensional plane. <br>
        This was the first project my hackathon team and I completed. We gained valuable experience
        in designing and implementing a project from scratch.</li>
    </ul>
