    <h2>Description</h2>

    For a majority of shoppers, a considerable amount of time and effort is spent on activities
    related to shopping. We have identified three activities that can be optimized: maintaining
    shopping lists, deciding which stores to shop at, and deciding the order or route to take while
    shopping. Using microservices that combine inventory data from usersâ€™ homes provided by
    sensors with nearby stores and maps services, we aim to create a system that saves shoppers
    time, money and effort. <br> <br>

    <h2>Role</h2>

    My main role in this project was designing the overall back end architecture, and also research
    several technologies for the application itself as well the services that support it. In other words,
    I was a back end engineer. <br> <br>
