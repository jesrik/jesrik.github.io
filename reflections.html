    My current short-term goal is to graduate in May and move to Rochester, MN in order to
    start my full-time job as an ASIC Design Verification Engineer with Western Digital. I do not
    necessarily have a set long-term goal for my career, but I do see myself with Western Digital for
    a long time and I also know that at this point in my career, I have no interest in pursuing
    management positions. <br> <br>

    My general education electives have helped me formulate and evaluate engineering
    solutions by collaborating with individuals from non-technical backgrounds. Different
    approaches and perspectives are valuable contributions to finding optimal solutions to all sorts
    of problems. <br> <br>

    Engineering solutions in problem solving and innovation may not always be optimal. For
    example, an engineering solution may not be the most optimal in terms of economy, global
    effect, and/or societal acceptance. Therefore, it is important to find the perfect balance between
    an efficient and successful engineering solution and its effects on different contexts. To expand
    on “perfect balance”, there will always be a trade-off between the contexts mentioned above. <br> <br>
